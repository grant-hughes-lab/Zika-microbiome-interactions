# Zika-microbiome-interactions
This repository contains the code to analyse the data and generate the figures for the paper 'Zika virus alters the microbiome differently in distinct field and lab-reared Aedes aegypti lines.' 

All the code is together in one R markdown file and the repository also contains the underlying data required to run all scripts.

The paper is currently on biorxiv under doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.02.02.636091
